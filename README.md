# **Budget Journal**

A clean and simple personal finance tracker built with **Django**.  
Designed for a single user to track income, expenses, and a basic household budget through a consistent and minimal interface.

I built this project to strengthen my Django skills and to demonstrate how I design and implement a small, complete web application — authentication, forms, templates, styling, and basic CRUD flows.

## 🚀 **About the Project**

**Budget Journal** allows a user to manage a straightforward personal budget:
- Create an account
- Log in/ Log out
- View and edit profile information
- Delete the profile

The scope is intentionally focused - the goal is clarity, not complexity.

I prefer code that is:
- easy to understand
- easy to maintain
- easy to extend when needed
